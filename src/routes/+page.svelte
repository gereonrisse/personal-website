            Since my early days, I've been immersed in the realm of sound – from doing technical studio work like mixing
            and mastering, working as a live sound engineer, and composing my own music.

            Five years ago, I ventured into the realm of software engineering, diving deep into data engineering, web
            app development, and eventually taking on project leadership roles.

            My passion for both sound and code converged when I embarked on a project in late 2022 – crafting a Digital
            Signal Processor (DSP), a sophisticated sonic computer that takes speaker systems to a new level.
